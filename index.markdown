Hello! I am Glaciosia, presently a senator in our legislature and a committed citizen of this Union. I am founding this paper as a way to serve the people of this region with our high quality, timely journalism on regional events. I can not claim to be unbiased, but I will strive to be as transparent as possible. This paper will publish news, op-eds, and letters to the editor; and conduct polls , interviews and debates.

Would you like to contribute opinion or news content to the paper, giving your writing distribution and respect? Would you like to assist in the runnning of debates, and make Unionists more politically involved and aware? Or would you like to flex your editorial muscles and make this paper the best it can be? Either way, your contibution is most welcome, and we would love to have you on staff at the UFP. Contact Glaciosia by discord or [email](join@unionfreepress.ga).
