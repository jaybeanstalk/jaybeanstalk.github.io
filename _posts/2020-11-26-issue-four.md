## General Assembly Amendment is dangerous and reckless
**Opinion |** Glaciosia
This amendment, which was proposed for the second time to the Senate recently, is intended to make the General Assembly into a body that has a fixed set of members and requires people to actively apply to participate. However, the amendment has serious issues in drafting and would remove, for a whole Senate term, someone who misses the voting period of 4 bills, making no distinction if they were on a leave of absence, and cause further problems for our general assembly. The Senate should defeat this rushed, flawed and incomplete amendment and reintroduce one drafted properly.
## Interview with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General Guess and Check (Zukchiva)

*Firstly, can you describe your ministry for the readers?*  
The Ministry of Justice is responsible for maintaining an attorney system for the Union. The Ministry is also supposed to educate the general citizenry about Union law. That’s the extent of its duties.

*Why did you accept this position? Were you at any point apprehensive of taking this post?*  
I accepted the position because I wanted to be of service. I was actually surprised by the offer, but took it anyways since I felt that I could do the job properly. Plus, I wanted to experience what it would be like to serve in the Union’s Executive (Druing offered me the position before Phoenix made me Vice-President).

I was apprehensive due to time constraints. I devote a lot of time to the East Pacific, so I was unsure if I could really devote time to the Ministry of Justice. However, it seems that everything is working out, so that’s pretty swell!

*In your confirmation hearing, you said that the defeated Judicial Bill was rushed through and you were not happy. Now that you are the Minister of Justice, will you do anything to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again?*

I cannot do anything in that regard solely as Minister of Justice. However, as a private citizen, I would definitely speak out more loudly against such a bill. And very possibly cast a NAY against it when it goes to vote. 

Additionally, should Law School get set up during my term, we can probably make a course on legislative procedure, with part of the course encouraging citizens/Senators to only submit well thought out and well drafted bills.

In the same hearing, you were asked about the Union Bar Association. You were not aware of the President’s plan regarding the UBA at that time? Are you in the know now? What are your specific plans for UBA?
Yes, I was not aware of the President’s plans at the time, but I am in the know now. I believe that the President’s plans can be easily accommodated into what I am planning as of now.

As for the UBA, the plan is to come up with some sort of test to examine an applicant’s legal certification. Whether passing said test would lead to one becoming a formal attorney, or just giving them a certification of legal knowledge, is still being decided. But overall, the hope of this rendition of the MoJ is to simply get the test out and get the UBA functional. 

*As Attorney General, you are going to advise the President on the legality of any bill brought before them. On what parameters do you examine a bill? Are they always the same for all the bills?*

Well, they are the same for all bills, yes. Or most- one can never say never.

So first, obviously is legality. I mainly do this by examining other law. Is there something that conflicts? Does the law conflict the Constitution? Things like that. If there is such a conflict, then I may suggest a veto. 

The second is quality. How well is the legislation written? Is it written well, or written horribly? Our legislature hasn’t really passed a “horribly written” bill yet, so I’m not too worried in this regard, but it may happen in the future: again, you never know.

The third and final check is what is the effect of said bill (culturally, socially, politically, etc.)? And is the effect a good or bad one? Arguably, this is the most important parameter through which I advise the President. Understanding the social and political implications of a bill is just as important as determining its legality.

*Before being appointed minister, you were the Vice President under Phoenix for about a month. Does this experience count in your ministership? Or am I wrong in comparing the two?*

I would say that the Vice-Presidency did not help me that much in doing my current job. However, it gave me the chance to become acclimated to the environment I would serve in as a Minister. So in some regards, it was a helpful position, and I am thankful to Phoenix for giving me the opportunity to serve (<3). 

*How is the minister of justice of great importance to the Union? For an average citizen, what effectiveness does this office hold?*

The Minister of Justice, or the Attorney General, is an important figure in the Union. They are the main prosecutor within the Union. Additionally, they advise the President on how to sign on bills. In effect, the Minister of Justice wields a great deal of power and influence over the Executive.

For an average citizen, the Ministry isn’t the most active nor at the forefront of their mind, unlike Census or Culture. Justice deals with a small niche of citizens interested within the law. Outside of that niche, the Ministry is not that effective at all (besides when prosecuting citizens suspected of being criminals).

*Do you have any specific policy proposals that you want to bring up in this term?*

Besides creating a test? Not really. There is some development of a law school (started by Glac) that I wish to continue. But besides those two things, I don't really have specific policy proposals to propose.
