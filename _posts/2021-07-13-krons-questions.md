The Union Free Press, in cooperation with President Kronprinzessin, will be hosting a regular question and answer program with *YOUR* questions. There will be a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGcT4l_OWRyD0SECVgK5WT0lFHetNlYtLmETEsqhl4gWBCaw/viewform?usp=sf_link) available for everyone to submit questions, and once a week I will check them to see if 5 or more questions have been submitted. If they have them, Kron and I will have a chat for all of you to follow where we discuss these questions. I hope this partnership will expand the civil discourse and liveliness of political life in this region, and thank Kron for her willingness in this endeavor.
