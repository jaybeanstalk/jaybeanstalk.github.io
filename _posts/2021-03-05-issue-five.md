## Nuevo San Miguel Elected President

Former Minister of Culture Nuevo San Miguel was elected in an upset on the second of March, getting five more votes than his closest competitor, former President and expected winner Phoenix:

    + Nuevo San Miguel: 15 (56%)
    - Phoenix Coalition: 10 (37%)
    - Re-Open Nominations: 2 (7%)
  
NSM, along with his Vice President Zeneste have nominated, and the Senate confirmed, the following Ministers:

* Sacento as Minister of the Census
* Second United States Republic (Tanisha) as Minister of Culture
* The Glorious Hypetrain (Kade) as Minister of Defense
* Glaciosia (Glac) as Minister of Justice/Attorney General
* British Isles and Commonwealth Realms (Isles) as Minister of Foreign Affairs

The election of a newer, less well known candidate in an election is an interesting development, and some commentators have suggested it is de to an influx of voters from the citizens who primarily roleplay on the Union's seperate RP Discord server. How this will effect future elections is uncertain.
  
*Note: Glaciosia was Phoenix's running mate as Vice President and is a Minister in the NSM Presidency*

## Chairperson Elections Underway

At the moment of writing,the elections for Chairperson of the General Assembly are underway due to the office being vacated by the current Vice President upon his ascendance to office. The election is being conducted according to the internal rules of the General Assembly, and for the first time the Press is aware of, being conducted with a ranked choice system. Former Deputy Chairperson Josephto appears to be in the lead at this time.

## Senate Elections Moving Forward With Little Competition

The Chancellery announced the candidate list for the special election to replace President NSM's seat in the Senate on Friday, as follows:

* Alkonosta
* Kanglia
* Stewbone

Apart from Kanglia, the candidates are not well known, and he is expected to have an easy route to victory, but this has been a season of upsets, and no outcome is guaranteed.

## News in News: Khevo Announces New Paper, Kanglia's Corner Premieres Audio Segment

Khevo, a Chancellor and Associate Justice in the UDS has announced their new newspaper, known as *The Perennial*,which is "aiming to bring active and thought-provoking news, discussion, and analysis to the region." It can be found [here](https://perennial.theuds.org/).

Kanglia, a long-term citizen and current Senate candidate has announced that their paper, *Kanglia's Corner* will be holding a radio segment called "Kanglia's Questions", somewhat mirroring the PMQs of Westminster democracies. The first episode will air live at approximately 5 Central this Tuesday. Readers who wish to learn more or attend should join the UDS discord and read the #kanglias-corner channel.

## Interview with Former President Druing
**News  |** Isles

*Isles interviewed the former President Druing on his time in office*

*1. Now that you are a regular citizen of the Union, how does not being the President feel?*

I want my red name back.

*2. How would you summarise the time that you were Head of State?*

Could have been better.

*3. What do you think has been the most important event(s) in the Union during your Presidency and why?*

Aside from the Delegacy Act (increased autonomy of the WA Delegate by loosening/removing restrictions related to the Executive and the establishment of the Union’s World Assembly Advisory Board), FA, treaties and such which I mention later - This term’s mostly been setup; Starting things up to later be continued and hopefully completed, in future administrations. Put short, all the eventful events have been behind the scenes.

*4. What has been your momentous achievement, your crowning glory as President?*

Joining the PfS - It’s the first time to my knowledge that the Union has ever entered membership into a WA voting bloc, which gains its position on the international stage as well as sets uncharted ground for the region to step.

*5. You are a one term president, you had the opportunity to continue for another term. Why did you decide not to run for reelection?*

1. Slightly burnt out - Additionally, the things I had hoped to accomplish… Weren’t happening, really.

2. Running against Phoenix is suicide unless you’re a good leader. I’m not good at giving direction.

*6. Under your presidency, there were two attempts to reform the General Assembly. Do you feel any need to reform the Assembly? If so, how?*

The assembly does not need reform - Especially not now under the new RoP, it has become a much more effective institution now that Kron has given it the mechanisms it needs to operate more smoothlier. I’d recommend that the Senate also try to alter their RoP similarly to further improve the Legislature as a whole - At the very least, the merging of the Debate and Amendments period.

Additionally at some point, maybe not in the near future (because we can’t fill these positions with our dwindling population), but I would like to see the establishment and maintenance of some kind of elected Head of Legislature position or similar body - Someone above the Speaker and Chairperson that are partial (non-voting) members of both chambers that potentially allows the GA to hold the Senate (and vice-versa) to account if, for example - A bunch of frivolous and/or malicious proposals made it past one chamber to go to the other; which the other not only sees fit to reject, but also would consider it something to action, but not something big enough to bring to the Judiciary for a trial, like something they would just say should stay as in-house punishment, even though you can’t realistically do anything in-house about two separate chambers of the same house because there’s no mechanism for it.

Maybe it’s a dumb idea, I don’t know. Food for thought.

*7. The time in which you served as President, the Union made foreign treaties - Aurora Covenant and Partnership of Sovereignty. How do you view the Union’s treaties with these regions and what do you think about the direction in which the foreign relations of the UDS are headed?*

I’m happy to say that we’re doing exceedingly well. We can only improve when it comes to Foreign Affairs.

*8. Under your presidency, UDS saw a decline in overall membership. What do you believe needs to be done by the next administration to address this issue?*

Work with the Ministries of the Census and Culture to engage recruitment efforts and complete our States Project, as well as maintain and/or innovate in our cultural endeavours.

*9. In these past months, there has been talk of a new constitution. Indeed many people have seen the draft of one such replacement. Do you think it is necessary? According to you, is there an appetite for a constitutional convention?*

We’re not doing this again. It’s only been a year since we instated the current Constitution and getting into the habit of replacing it every so often is not ideal for our regional growth; I joined the region at the tail end of the last one and the proceedings for such reportedly dealt major damage to our regional population and with it already falling significantly, we really don’t need to chance potentially killing the region over things that can very well just be amended out.

*10. You had one of the most capable cabinet. What do you have to say about each ministry's achievements?*

They did good - I appointed them for their respective positions because I believed them to be the best people for their jobs. And they performed them admirably.

*11. As Election Day comes, do you have any preferences of the two candidates?*

You mean three. Go RON!

*12. As you return to being a normal citizen, what are your plans for the future? You had a successful stint as senator, minister and now as president. That is a wealth of experience. How will you channel that in the days that follow?*

I’m planning on sitting back and staying a citizen for the time being to focus on my other enterprises. I would like to remain a part of the World Assembly Advisory Board, as well as the delegation to the PfS until such a time that Asdersland sees fit to remove me, for whatever reason they may deem necessary.

My time with the PfS so far has been comfortable and thought-provoking. Additionally, just before as well as during my Presidency, I had been conversing with another region official about a potential opportunity. It hasn’t produced anything yet, but in the event that it does, I will try to see if I can make sure that it pays off. But I’ll refuse any other nominations for the time being. In time, I may run for President again or accept a VP nomination, but I don’t see it happening soon.
