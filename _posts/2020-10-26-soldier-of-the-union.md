Nationstates is rife with all kinds of regions; big and small. Full and empty, thriving and lacklustre, strong and weak, founderless, and vulnerable. There are regions and nations which prey upon those others who have gone down in this game. This class of vile, debasing, uncouth, unsavoury, and assailing regions and nations are called raiders. These vagabonds move in groups into these defenseless regions and take over their administration. On the other hand, there are honourable, upstanding, valiant, virtuous, and principled regions and nations which rise up to the call of duty and defend and liberate those who fell to the marauding raiders. They are called defenders or liberators, depending on their role. The Union of Democratic States is a defending region. We, and some others, have joined together into a commixture called Libcord.  

For those who might not be aware, the Union has its armed forces, namely, Union of Democratic States Armed Forces, ot UDSAF. The UDSAF is headed by the Minister of Defence. The Commander - in - Chief is the President of the Union. UDSAF follows a very straightforward chain of command; Recruit → Private → Sergeant → Captain → Major → Colonel. Each rank comes with its own eligibility and authority. There is also a reserve force, which is called upon in time of great need. I have been part of the UDSAF for about four months. I began as a recruit and presently, I am a Captain. I have earned my laurels and ribbons in the battlefield like many of my compatriots. I have become somewhat of a poet (though only a very bad one), commemorating our victories. You too can do all this and more by enlisting into the UDSAF.  

All the NationStates’ a battle,  
And all the UDSAF merely soldiers.  
They have their roles and duties,  
And one player in their time plays many parts.  
Their acts being seven ranks. At first, the recruit,  
Asking and questioning everything in training.   
Then the stumbling private, with their new puppets,  
And shining virgin face, employing for the first time in battle,  
Willingly to defend the Union. And then the sergeant,  
Fresh from the war, with battle scars,  
Fought to their superiors’ pride. Then a captain,  
Full of strange paths and swearing like a sailor,  
Jousting in honour, sudden and quick in battle,  
Seeking the final victory,  
Even in the disarraying updates. And then the major,  
In fair round belly with experience thickly lined,  
With eyes severe and beard a formal cut,  
Full of wise saws and modern instances;  
And so they play their parts. In sixth rank shifts,  
Into the authority of colonel  
With the bot at their command and speed on their side,  
Their keystrokes, well thumbed, a help far and wide.  
For their high rank, and their speed,  
Leaving others in the dust at their feet.  
And receives dps well won. Last rank of all  
That ends this hierarchy in the military’s hall,  
Is commander and commander in chief,  
With command, with authority, with power, with everything.  


In the four months that I have been a Union soldier, we have gone toe - to - toe with three very strong and powerful raider groups which had invaded and conquered regions; namely, South Pacific (not to be confused with The South Pacific), Middle Earth (yes, that one), and Smol Fur Empire (don’t even ask). There were also plenty of smaller raider groups, but these are the ones that come to mind when I think of war. UDSAF and its allies in the Libcord attacked South Pacific constantly over a week and longer. Attack and retreat, attack and retreat, attack and retreat; it went on and on and on. For Smol Fur Empire too. Middle Earth was fairly quick. If only Souron had come to us instead of his goblin army. The joy and exhilaration of victory was limitless and the euphoria stuck with us until the next one. To commemorate our victory, I composed a poem:  

Friends, nations, UDSAF men, lend me your ears.  
I come to praise our Union, not brag about it  
The good that we do lives after our operations.  
The liberation is oft left unsung in our chambers.  
So let it not be anymore. The noble Kanglia  
Hath told you that we have been manytimes successful.  
'Tis not an exaggeration when he says so.  
For we hath defeated the ocean in the south  
And the land in the centre, and ejected in glory.  
We fought in the evening, we fought in the afternoon  
We fought at midnight, we fought in early morn  
We fought under the glaring sun, we fought under a gentle moon.  
And thus defeated them and emerged victorious.  
Twelve ribbons for Kanglia, and twelve for Comlogical,  
Eleven ribbons for Asdersland, ten for Glaciosia,  
Nine ribbons for We The People, eight for Phoenix,  
Seven ribbons for Zeneste, six for Firseria  
Five ribbons for Procesia, and five for humble Isles  
In the web of NationStates, where the oppressed cry,  
One UDSAF to detag them all, one UDSAF to chase them,  
One UDSAF to defend them all, and in the update liberate them,  
In the web of NationStates, where the oppressed cry.  

Such high spirits and such elation comes only with fellow soldiers who fought together, and now gather around the bonfire and share stories. Being a part og the UDSAF, being a soldier of the Union has been a great experience so far. And more is yet to come.  

Fled region, enemy did, never to return,  
The region safe, for now, till next update’s turn.  
Rejoice, all ye soldiers, rejoice while you can,  
For be vary of victory, she never stays long with any man.
